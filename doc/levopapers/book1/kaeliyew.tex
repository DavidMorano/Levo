\section{Introduction}
The term reliability usually refers to the probability that a
component or system will operate satisfactorily either at any particular
instant at which it is required or for a certain length of
time.Fundamental to quantifying reliability s a knowledge of how to
define, assess and combine probabilities.This may hinge on identifying the
form of the variability which is nherent n most processes.If all
components had a fixed known lifetime there would be no need to model
reliability.
