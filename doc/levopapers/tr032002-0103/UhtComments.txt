1. Typos. Proofread extremely carefully before sending this in. E.g., there's
a typo in the first word of the paper's title.

2. In General: data is sparse and uncorrelated. Need discussion, as Dave K.
will presumably do. As I have noted before, the branch characteristics
support the use of DEE, but do not explain it. Except for one benchmark,
the results do not appear that impressive. Suggest you at least mention the
overall final IPC with D-paths to show that the 10-20% improvement leads to
big(ger) IPC (performance).

3. The benchmark names are presented in different orders throughout the
paper. Pick one order, I suggest alphabetical, and stick with it, 
otherwise you're going to drive the reader nuts.

4. Section 1, par. 2, last sentence: this is out of place.

5. ", par. 4, last sentence: awkward; delete?

6. Section 2, background: don't forget the first ones: IBM 360/91,
and Riseman and Foster (1972).

7. Section 2, par. 2, second sentence from end: awkward.

8. next sentence: need reference for this.

9. Section 3.1, par. 2, sent. 3, middle: Tomasulo did this too.

10. Figure 1: basically good. Loop around of forwarding path is never
explained. Need to show RFU's, otherwise no scalability. 
Somewhere else in the paper, you refer to the relay delay as one cycle,
but it should be one cycle per column.
You might want
to use a version of the machine figure I used in the SSGRR paper.

11. Section 3. In general: concise view of relevant factors of Levo to
the paper.

12. " 3.1, par. 6, last 2 sentences. Huh? As is, will just confuse the reader.
Suggest you mention RFU's explicitly, or equivalent structure.

13. sec. 3.1, last par: huh? Delete.

14. Section 3.2, par. 1: why is confidence being mentioned? we don't use it,
at least not yet. Suggest you leave out all references to confidence.

15. ", par. 2, sent. 2 & 3: why put in? delete.

16. ", par. 3, sent. 4: "certain" to "most"

17. ", last par.: correct citation to tech report, add reference.

18. Section 4.1: what branch predictor was used? What size L1 cache?

19. Section 4.1: good characteristics. Can these be correclated with
later data?

20. Fig. 2 and 3: fine, but clean up labeling, as mentioned before.

21. All graphs: see my previous emails for comments, doesn't look like
they've been addressed.

22. Sec. 4.2: define static fetch.

23. Sec. 5.2: see previous comments on RFU's.

24. Sec. 5.2, par. 4: no such 16-8-4 configuration.

25. Sec. 5.2: other configs. better than 8-8-8.

26. Figure 6 and on: many have wrong benchmark in caption.

27. Figure 5 and on: again, make Y-origin 1, remove data for 0-paths
(is always 1)
