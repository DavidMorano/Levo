1. on value prediction: was Dave's AS snarfing delay mechanism used?
no.

2. Compress still looks weird. The numbers are low, they're about the same
for all IDEAL/REAL assumptions, and IDEAL_MEM to REAl F/M IPC goes the 
wrong way.
??? will look at it at instruction level ???

3. Are we using the SimpleScalar results from a couple of days ago
for the baseline?
yes.

4. line 40: is this prediction rate for this configuration WITH value
prediction?
~yes. 8_4_8 - 2_2_1, realistic, yes.

5. Prior results were without value prediction? Without per row predictors?
earlier date - yes; blue - no - with 1cycle bus delay

6. Need another config: realistic assumptions-  8_4_8 - 4_4_4 configuration.
have it at line 22.

7. What is spanning bus length, in ASs? (That's the loading factor, not
SG's, as I recall?
1 column throughout.

8. What were L0 cache sizes? Data with varying L0 sizes?
32 entries. Not yet.

9. Data with variable forwarding unit delays, including 0 (same as infinite
spanning bus length)?
no.

10. What's "great fetch" (lines 58-60)?
 Great front-end predictor? What are its parameters?
synthetic better predictor. 96% .  no great front-end predictor.

11. Please refresh my memory: what is the D-spawning algorithm?
Do we have data with/without newer version?
release. see PACT ; was best method.

12. Maybe you said this: 64_16_16 data for ideal mem and real f/m?
will get them.

13. Are we unrolling loops at I-Fetch time?
yes.

14. ijpeg results also look low, anomalous (config to config, lines
7-8, 13-14.
yes; bus contention

15. I-cache params.? Do I-accesses go through L2, main mem?
see Dave's email. yes.
l0/l1 bus lines not interleaved. m buses in exec. window not interleaved

16. Refresh my memory: what exactly is Ideal I-fetch? Perfect domain/no-
domain prediction?
never flushes, perfect I-fetch predictor. not an oracle. not a perfect oracle
due to changing predicates, DEE paths.

17. vary branch distance threshold ---TBD



more contention for buses.


misprediction w/ D-path - FU's re-issue results from d-path column; 
later m-path state kept.

line 53 one overall instead of one per row

results with real great predictor
