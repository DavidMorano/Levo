Subject: Re: Data on Spanning bus and FU and BUS delay

Hi all,
	Just wanted to share some real good news from some data Ali recently
obtained; looks like we can conclude:

WRT Spanning bus length:

Conclusion: 1. Knee of spanning bus length is at 8; get most performance 
	with 8 SG/bus, not much more with 16 or 32. Get isolated 
	significant increases from 8 to 32, but on whole not much.

Conclusion: 2. 1. Is true for large geometries, too. (Exception: "go")	

Conclusion: 3. Rows 16-19: looks like number of columns is big factor for 
	larger config., but too little data to be sure; see 64-16-16 vs 
	32-8-8 and vs 16-8-8.

>>>Ali and Dave: see if you can fit 64-16-16 back in the TBD geometries; but
TBD last.

WRT Forwarding unit and bus delay:

Conclusion: for 8-8-8, not very sensitive to FU delay, but are sensitive 
	to Bus delay. (Ali, why the latter but not the former? Are other
	buses affected? Which ones?) Drop in perf. of about 16% for FU
	delay from 1 cycle to 3 cycles. Drop in perf. of about 5%, 0 cycles
	to 1 cycle.

NOTE that the above data/conclusions confirm 2 of the basic Levo/resource
flow hypotheses: Most data is consumed within a short distance from the
point of generation. AND: small delays in the FU's/buses can be tolerated,
presumably because the data sent across FU's/buses is only needed later
in the computation, that is, the latency is hidden.

And possibly: performance scales with number of columns. (but why not
	SGs/column?)

BINGO! I love data.....
