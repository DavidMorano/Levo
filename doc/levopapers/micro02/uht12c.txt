Subject: Bus delay for cache access

Hi Ali,
	Please refresh my memory: did it make a big difference going from
a bus delay of 1 cycle for L1D cache accesses (plus the 1 cycle cache
access time) to 0 cycles (plus the 1 cycle L1D cache access time), 
for the IDEAL F/M case? What delay are you 
currently using for that bus delay?
	Thanks.
