Gus,

Since we changed the input for the COMPRESS program, I also re-ran the
SimpleScalar run to get a new IPC using that new input.  The old IPC
for the Spec reference input was 1.57.  Using the new input (that
allows coverage of the whole program in the first 600M instructions),
the new IPC from SimpleScalar also went up (as also Levo did) and is 1.88.

All of the numbers for SimpleScalar are repeated below for reference.
