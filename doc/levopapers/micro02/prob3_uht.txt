Hi. Pursuant to our conversation of yesterday, these are the experiments
I think we need to run. Please check thoroughly and let us all know if
I've missed any. Good luck.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

For all experiments, unless noted otherwise:
- use spanning bus length of 8 SGs (might want to do exp. 8. first)
- use geometry, etc., that does not constrain performance; parameters maxed.

Give to me, in Excel spreadsheet, for each experiment:
- assumptions
- data
- quantitative conclusions
- qualitative conclusions


1. Performance as function of static/dynamic I-Fetch domain size threshold.

2. Performance as function of L0 size, latency. (BTB, what is L0 latency?)

3. Performance with/w/out L0.

4. Performance with smaller branch predictors for per row predictors. Want
to get the size down by factor of 10 or more, if possible. May need tuning
here. Find knee in curve.

5. Once data value prediction works with counter solution, reduce predictor
size as much as possible; find knee in curve.

6. Performance effect of assuming main memory latency of 800 cycles. This was
suggested by Bob Colwell, and seconded by yours truly. In this case use
typical geometry and assumptions.

7. Performance effect of much better branch predictor in I-Fetch. Redo 1.

8. Performance as function of spanning bus length.

9. Performance of 2-2-1 bus geometry with the four ideal/real assumptions,
and with all of the results of the prior experiments incorporated, for high
IPC with realistic assumptions. Use current geometries, plus 8-8-8. If time
is running short, get rid of the high-end geometry (64-16-16?)

10. Other bulk data: performance as function of SG/col, AS/SG, columns;
with constant spanning bus length (8 SGs; for 4-x-x, use 4 SGs, unless you
can currently model a spanning bus two columns long).

Get back to me with estimate of how long it will take, wall clock time, to do 
one complete run of 9 and 10; don't include error time, I'll include it.
