Hi all,

Here's the plan for MICRO. I have tried to take all of your comments
into account. (Please note that one BIG hole left concerns the
benchmarks; Dave M. and Ali are currently thrashing through this one.
[Dave K., Dave M. informs me that the problem is not benchmarks per se
but the homebrew tools used to generate the traces for them, for the
MIPS machine. Thus, it's not SPECint or something else, it's MIPS vs.
something else (say Alpha).] I strongly oppose moving to a new ISA at
this point. I think it's opening a big can of worms. I believe Dave K.
agrees with me on this. Thus, the thrust is to devise methods to get
the bugs out of the tools real fast. Dave M. and Ali are coming (have
come) up with a plan to address this.)

First, the big picture. The paper will have the following
topics/contents:

- supremely clear, concise, illuminating description of Levo
microarchitecture with example.

- more benchmark results (see above)

- basic characterization of Levo wrt geometry (w-x-y-z)

+- concentrate on machine geometries realizable in, say, 5 years
(that's likely to be something(s) around 8-8-8-8) for other
characterization data

+- perform profiling as needed to explain the results and generate
directions for further IPC gains

Summary: tell what Levo is, how well it works, and why it works that well.

- We need to be able to completely justify our results. This requires
both the explanatory simulations mentioned above, as well as real
subsidiary components (like the memory system).  WRT the latter, we
must be able to argue and demonstrate that Levo can operate at high
frequencies with large main memory and L2 latencies. Part of this comes
from the regular simulations above, once the memory parameters are
determined to model real application hit rates, etc., and part of it
comes from a high-level layout with analysis.

Deadlines:
Paper due: Monday June 10, 2002
W/extension: Monday June 17, 2002

No info yet on paper length. Presumably the usual. PDF.

Our general schedule: from today, 4/9/2002, that's about 10 weeks to
get it all done. ALL data taking for the paper will CEASE 2.5 to 3
weeks before the due date. The paper will be ready for our own external
reviews 2 weeks before the due date.

Status reports: Tues. 2 PM and Fri. 2 PM, every week, starting with Fri.
4/12/2002. No more than half a page. (Same as before.)
