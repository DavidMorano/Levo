Professor Uht does not understand the problem with the DEE column
being in an earlier ML SG-column than its associated conditional
branch.  He wants DEE columns to be completely independent of the ML
SG-column that they are in.  I think that we can :

1) explain this to him more if we can

2) pretend that we have it

What do you think is the best course of action ?
