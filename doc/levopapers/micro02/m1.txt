Subject: adding the Alpha predictor
To: (Alireza Khalafi) akhalafi@ece.neu.edu

Ali,

One way to do it is to add the files under directory :
	~morano/src/levomods/
			/bpalpha.[ch]
			/uc_malloc.c
			/vsystem.h
			/misc.h

to FastLevo (C files get added to the existing C file, and the
headers get put in the same directory for inclusion.

An alternative way is to put the include file :
	~morano/src/levomods/
			/bpalpha.h

in your directory and then to link the file ;
	~morano/src/levomods/
			/levomods.obj

with your existing other objects (one or more).

For an example of calling the subroutines, you can look at the C
language file :
	~morano/src/traceproc/
			/stats.c
to see how the various parameters are given to the subroutines.

Of course, you can also look at the C code directly (file 'bpalpha.c').

The initialization subroutine 'bpalpha_init()' takes three (3)
configuration type arguments that give the size of the predictor
tables.  Use the numbers (in order of the config. arguments to the 
initialization subroutine) :
	512
	1024
	4096

This gives a predictitor with a reasonably close number of
bits as with the existing PAg.  I may work out something closer
tomorrow, but this is good enough for now.

Don't hesitate to ask me anything about the subroutines or about
calling them and giving the right arguments.  It is fairly simple
(trivial) as compared with using the value predictor (for example).

Thanks for everything,
Dave M.
