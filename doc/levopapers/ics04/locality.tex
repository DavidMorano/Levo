This work was substantially inspired by the prior work 
of Franklin et al ~\cite{Franklin92}
in their investigation of register traffic
for use in the context of the Multiscalar-like microarchitectures.
Prior work on memory locality has been substantial including
such work as Madison et al ~\cite{madison76characteristics},
Verkamo et al ~\cite{verkamo85emperical}, and more recently
that of Phalke et al ~\cite{phalke95gap} with their Inter-Reference
Gap model.
