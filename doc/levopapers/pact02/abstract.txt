Realizing High IPC Through a Large Microarchitecture

This paper explores a microarchitecture that can achieve high execution
performance on conventional single-threaded program codes.  Larger
microarchitectures can speculatively have possibly several hundreds of
instructions in-flight simultaneously.  This provides a means to
extract larger amounts of instruction level parallelism even from
programs that are very sequential in nature.  However, several problems
are associated with a large microarchitecture.  Among these are
scalability issues and the fact that mispredicted control flow can
cause large numbers of instructions to be squashed, wasting valuable
machine resource-clock slots.

We present a basic overview of our microarchitecture and how it
addresses the problem of scalability.  We also show how multipath
execution addresses the problem of mispredicted conditional branches by
avoiding or reducing the penalties associated with them.  We provide
simulation results for several configurations of our microarchitecture
that illustrate how higher ILP can be extracted from serial-oriented
integer programs.  We also present data that shows the positive effects
of applying multipath execution to the same programs.  Finally, we
present some data that shows the insensitivity of the machine performance
to some varying aspects of the memory hierarchy.
