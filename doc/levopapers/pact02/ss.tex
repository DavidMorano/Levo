For each table we also present the IPC results for each program
on a baseline
conventional superscalar machine.  The conventional machine was
simulated using SimpleScalar \cite{Austin97} using the PISA
instruction set (a MIPS-like instruction set) and 
used a machine configuration that
matched as closely as possible the various parameters listed
in Table \ref{tab:params} above.  
The IPC results from SimpleScalar
serve as a baseline for comparison and are repeated, and
labeled \textit{baseline}, in each of the results.
