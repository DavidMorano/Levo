Hi Dave,

This looks good, I like the grid, it lays things right out.

OK, let me try to recreate the scene of the crime:

1)	i2

	i4

i4 writes to register input of i2: say why i4's value is ignored (it's later)

2)	i0

	i2

	i4

i0 writes to register input of i2: why it is grabbed (you've done this)

3)	i0
	i1
	i2

	i4

i1 writes to "" " i2: why it is grabbed (you've done this)

4)  hmmm. I think you've covered everything except 1), the trivial case.
Take one last think about it.

Yes, I will most likely be online tonight.

Examples: you've got a good start on this. Add a predicate example.
Also include some kind of example with a forwarding register between the
source and destination.

I'll include all of what you've sent me, polish it, and send back the
document. It may take a couple of hours, I have to fit dinner in there
somewhere, most likely.  :-)

Also, you may have noticed my forwarding buses figure did not include 
the right stuff for column renaming, because I forgot about that, but
I will address this somehow.


Thanks! We're getting there.
