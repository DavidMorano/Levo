Dear D. Kaeli,

How are you? With me, everything is fine. I'm currently finishing my PhD.
I had my first defense here last week with Jim Smith and Pradip Bose in my
committee. Within two weeks I will have my final defense. Afterwards I
will send you my PhD dissertation book, because I know you are interested
in my work, and I always enjoyed meeting you at conferences. I will send
the PhD book through regular mail. So, please give me your address.

I have seen a paper you are working on on your website: `` Implications of
Register and Memory Temporal Locality for Distributed
Microarchitectures''. I can make the following suggestions. First, I have
measured these distributions too, see the paper I published in PACT-2001.
And I observed a power law distribution. Second, Butts and Sohi published
a paper in the last MICRO that deals with the degree-of-use of register
instances. So, maybe this is useful for your work too.

greetings,
Lieven Eeckhout
