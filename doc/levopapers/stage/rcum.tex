For better clarity,
in Figure \ref{fig:a_rcum} we show the cumulative 
register interval data over all
benchmark programs.  
That figure shows, in order, all three of the access
intervals that we explored: access-use, useful-lifetime, and def-use.

The density is shown on the left and the distribution is shown
on the right.
All intervals are measured in dynamic numbers of executed instructions.}
