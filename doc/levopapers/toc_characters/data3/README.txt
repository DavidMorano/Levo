This is a second set of data for memory (Thursday night Sep. 5).
This does not include lifetime-close-out for the memory (neither did it
for the registers -- but we want to ignore them anyway for
errors due to missing instructions).

This has both 64K long 2^0 density tables and 2^10 density tables
for the memory stuff.  The register stuff only has the 2^0 tables.
Also, there is the overflow indicator in the statistics summary
files.
