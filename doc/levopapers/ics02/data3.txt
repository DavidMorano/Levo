I have put all three graphs in one.  Do you prefer to get them
individually in seperate files?

here are the speedup graphs.  I created them in matlab and haven't yet
figures how to fix the x axis labeling.  I might need to use PPT if I
cannot fix this.

Here is the IPC graph, The xaxis corresponds to 
go , gap , bzip, gzip and parser from left to right.

each group consists of the following configurations
(left to right)

    SG    AS    Columns
     8     4    16
     8     4     8
     8     8     8
     8     8    16
     8    16    16
     8    16     8
