Hi Dave,
Here is the first draft on Dynamic Predication and Fetch Heuristics.  Let me
know what you think.  It is basically very similar to what we had in ToC.  I
still need to create new graphs.

I remember a while ago you wrote a paper on dynamic predication.  Maybe you
could use some of that if
it would save time.

Thanks
Alireza
