Hi gang,

I have incorporated everybody's changes.  The paper is now 36 pages (
also fixed the font problems), though I can will fix in a final formatting
review.   Also, I will fix the pagination (breaking in the middle of
transactions)....

Please read one more time and we will be done with it.

Thanks

Dave
