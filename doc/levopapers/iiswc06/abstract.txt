We explore several access intervals (measured in instructions) between
register assignments and the subsequent uses of the same registers.
Likewise, we also explore memory stores and the subsequent loads from
the same memory addresses.  Three different types of access intervals
are defined and data are gathered on them through the simulated execution
of benchmark programs.  These data serve to provide insight about how a
future distributed microarchitecture might take advantage of the register
or memory access behavior in order to reduce the overhead of accessing
centralized machine resources like a register file or the L1 memory cache.
