I spent some time reading the text you already produced.  Overall,
the intro is well written and presents the machine without sounding
like you are crazy (a real bonus over some of the Levo papers).  But
I do have some suggestions for improving on this text:

1. Somewhere in the intro you need to through some details in about
this machine.  1 or 2 sentences only.  And you need to include a
quantitative sentence about how much benefit we can expect from this
microarchitectural approach.

2. Make sure to include a number or two in the abstract. We want the
reader to want to read on.

3. All of your diagrams are too big.  Reduce their size.

4. In Figure 1, I find the fact that the register file and the LSQ
share a single read and write bus to be a real issue.  I you were
only trying to show a logical connection.

I just worry that the casual reader will look at Figure 1 and say "Why
would I ever design a datapath that is so bus constrained???"  If you
have 128 IS's sharing a single read and a single write bus, the really
worry about this design.  I doubt that is the case.

5. On page 5, you cite "prior work."  I would suggest call it "our
prior work" and then comment out the citation in the reference list.
Also, there are probably too many citations to Levo.  You should probably
comment out 1 or 2 more, though you should also leave 1 or 2 in (though
don't refer to it as "our prior work" in these instances.

I reread where you compare the present work with Levo.  Since you already
draw a connection to another project, you really don't need to say too
much about being different from Levo.....

6. Since ICS this year is being run by MIT folks, I think you need to
cite an MIT project in the related work.  I would suggest the RAW project.

Overall, try to make your figures less vague and more meanful.

Dave,

Figure 2 also leaves my uninspired.  While it has boxes with names
on them, I really don't get any insight into the function of any of
these boxes.

I don't see where these boxes are loaded.  I don't see where they
are used (most feed into Figure 4).  By the way, can you redo Figure
4 so that everyone doesn't think this is just another Levo?  This is
pretty much the exact figure (maybe change the orientation of the
bus to match the rest of your datapath in Figure 2?)

Sorry, I don't mean to be so critical, but a picture is worth a
thousand words.

Dave
