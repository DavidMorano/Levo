PACT'02 paper experimental plan


Goal for paper
========================

I think that this paper is very similar to the previous ISCA and HPCA
paper from last year (2001).  We want to describe a new
microarchitecture for a future machine that can achieve high IPCs
(greater than 10).

First, I think that this means that we need to simulate some machine
sizes that clearly give IPCs of 10 or more.  Do you agree with this or
can we somehow stay with the existing sized machines that we have been
working with in the past (8-8-8 or so) ?


Simulation Parameters
=======================

The basic simulation parameters that affect the size of the
machine are :

+ number of SG rows

+ number of AS rows per SG

+ number of SG columns

Besides parameters for the basic size of the machine, we now also
can change (correct me if I am wrong with any one) :

+ size of L1 instruction cache

+ size of L1 data cache

+ size of unified L2 I/D cache

+ hit and miss penalties for L1 instruction cache

+ hit and miss penalties for L1 data cache

+ hit and miss penalties for unified L2 I/D cache

Note: the miss penalty for the unified L2 cache is the same
as the access delay to main memory.  Is this correct ?

We also can change some parameters associated with multipath
execution.  These are :

+ number of additional speculative paths besides the most
  predicted path (also know as the main-line path) ; this
  number can be anything from :

- 0 (additional paths are turned off)
- number of SG columns configured for the machine

Is it indeed true that you can set the number of additional speculative
paths up to the number of SG columns of the machine ?

Also, we will have the following "DEE" related parameter to play
with :

+ the earliest column number (relative to a conditional branch) where an
  additional speculative path is spawned from

Finally, we *may* have the following multipath parameters to play with :

+ the length of an alternative speculative path ("DEE" path)

+ some means to control the nature of the abandoning of existing
  alternative speculative paths in order to make resource room
  for new alternative speculative paths that are associated
  with later conditional branchs that have not yet had an additional
  speculative path spawned for it yet


Questions
=======================

Are there any other parameters that you will have available that
can be changed in the simulator that you think might be useful
for this PACT paper ?
