Kaeli

I made a fairly long list of notes on corrections.  I suspect
you are working on these as we speak.  I am not sure what else
I can do.  I am going to take a break for an hour and log back
in around midnight my time.

Comments:

1. Run spell on the file.  Spelling error in title.
2. My last name is lowercase.  reorder email addresses.
3. You are fairly stingy with your use of commas.  The
first sentence needs a comma.
4. Your style is very wordy.  Your second setence is a mouthful.
Could you make a pass through the paper and look for needlessly
long sentences?
5. Spend time on the abstract.  There is nothing worse than starting
off on the wrong foot with a reviewer.
6. Section 1, 2nd sentence, we can not mitigate penalties, can we?
7. Another good example of being too wordy Section 1, 3rd paragraph,
delete "as yet..."
8. Page 2, first paragraph, "aggressive large-scale" (you minimally need
a common, though I might suggest some simpler language).
9. Page 2, 2nd paragraph, what is the most predicted path??
10.Page 2, 2nd paragraph, most speculatively executed?? What does this
mean?
11. Page 2, 3rd paragraph, drop all initials (non-standard).
12. Page 2, 4th paragraph, user numbers for sections (e.g., section 2, etc.)
13. Section 2, first sentence, why are attempts old??
14.  Page 3, first paragraph, you need a citation for the Sun Ultra 4 
comment.
15. Section 3, first sentence "the good handling" the proper handling??
16. 2nd paragraph Table Table.
17. 3rd paragraph (too short).
18. 4th paragraph.  I would hold off talking about hammocks until
after you show the branch domains.  Don't let the cat out of the
bag until you are ready.  Otherwise this will be a boring paper.
It is like knowing the murder on page 1 of a murder mystery.
19. 5th paragraph, "the distribution of the percentage of the number"
which one is it??
20. 6th paragraph, difernt is mispelled.
21.Figure 1, ouch.  Needs to total to 100.  Need a label of
the units on the y axis.  Need to use different style lines and
a legend for the 5 programs (so much for my idea of 5 graphs).
22. Below Figure 1, "We classify each....  being either a high dynamic
frequency (how about frequently executed)....
23. Fix Figure 2.  No labels, too much white space,
we need to fix this.
24. My figure uses the terms mainline and disjoint.  Does this
fit your terminology?
25. In 4.1, don't say abbreviated (just put the abbreviation
in parens right after the words).  It can also help to capitalize
the abbreviated word.
26. I am going to overlook all spelling errors.  I am finding
a lot.  Please run spell many times on the tex.
27. Section 4.  It would be great if you could show some simple
figure of how static fetch catches the hammock shown in the 
previous figure (the one I sent you).
28. Good to see Static fetch defined.  This formatting needs
some cleaning up.
29. I notice you are avoiding all mention of Levo.  Is this on
purpose?  I don't really care, it is up to you.
30. Explanation of Figure 5 in text. I think it is obvious just
from the figure what the order of bars is all about.  I labeled
the bars with the benchmark names in larger fonts.
31. You should present the machine configurations before showing 
Figure 5.  You should explain your reasons for selecting this
range.
32.  8-8-8 does not give the best IPC.  Am I going crazy??  
33. You don't simulate 16-8-4.  Are you going crazy?
34. Figure 6, you need to explain bzip and then the funny
sweet spot in gap 8,8,16.
35. There is presently no discussion of the data.  Please don't say
as we increase x, y increases too.  You need to say why.  You need
to indicate if it is interesting.  You need to say a lot.  Right
now there isn't any discussion.

Okay, you have a ton to do.  Good luck.  This is hard stuff, but at least
you can appreciate the shit that I go through each time :-)

Cheers,

Dave
