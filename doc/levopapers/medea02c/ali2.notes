Hi

I tought you might be interested in the following statistics.  The
data shows the percentage of all executed loads that are satisfied in L0,
L1, L2 or Main Memory.  The percentage of loads that go to the
memory are very low (less than 0.1%).  L0 satisfies around %25 - %35 of
the loads which I think is very good.  The "L0 bwreq" are the percentage 
of loads satisfied by sending a backwarding request and "L0 snoop" are the
percentage that are satisfied by snooping the forwarded values without
sending a backwarding request.

As you see the L0 cache in 16-8-8 doesn't satisfy as many loads as 8-4-8.
I think this is because there are more speculative loads in 16-8-8 that
do not hit at L0.  One problem with large configurations is that the
distance between recenly issued instruction and committed ones is too far
that the issued instructions do not have a correct initial value to start
with.  Although this is just a guess.

No.  It is a constant for each configuration.

For 4-4-4 it is 4 (total of 4 MFUs in the machine)
For 8-4-8 it is 8 (total of 8 MFUs in the machine)
For 16-8-8 it is 8 (total of 16 MFUs in the machine)

I also like to mention a couple things.  The data shows that we are
very sensitive to L1 delay but not very sensitive to DRAM delay.  This
shows that maybe we are not capturing much of the memory accesses
in the execution window.  The reason that we are not very sensitive to
DRAM dealy might be that most of the memory requests are satisfied by L1
cache.  Also note that for the larger machines there is more speculative
memory accesses which means more traffic on the buses.  

I am running simulations with 1 cycle dealy for L1 I-cache dealy and also
using a Perfect Fetch that might give us a better insight into what is
happening.  I should have the data in a couple hours.
