Dear Author,

Thank you for your submission to MEDEA 2002.  We are pleased to inform 
you that your paper, titled

"Realizing High IPC Through a Scalable Memory-Latency Tolerant Multipath 
Microarchitecture"
has been accepted for presentation in the MEDEA 2002 Workshop.
Informal Proceedings will be distributed at the Workshop. They also will 
appear in a special issue of ACM SigArch Computer Architecture NEWS (we 
are now establishing the possible date of publication).

Please carefully take into account the enclosed comments by the
reviewers when preparing the camera-ready version.

The paper length is limited to 10 pages and must be written in standard 
IEEE format for conference Proceedings (see the link in the home page: 
http://garga.iet.unipi.it/medea )

Your camera-ready paper is due on September 1, 2002 (not the 7 of August). 
You (or one of your co-authors, if any) are required to attend the 
workshop as a condition of publication; if this is a
problem, please notify us **immediately**.


 
 
Congratulations on having your paper accepted. We look forward to see 
you in Charlottesville.

Sincerely,

Sandro Bartolini, Pierfrancesco Foglia, Cosimo Antonio Prete
Medea 2002 Workshop organizing Committee.

 >>This paper investigates the best utilization of a large mesh
of PEs to execute a single-threaded program. The architecture
can provide a 50% increase in the IPC for some SPEC benchmarks.
This extra IPC could be exploited to realize a memory-latency
tolerant multipath architecture.

The paper provides an important contribution and it is well
suited for the purpose of the MEDEA workshop.

Nevertheless, I'd recommend the authors to address the following
points.

- Methodology:

* It would be interesting to see what are the results
for the all SPEC-2000 suite, in order to provide an important
reference point for all the researchers willing to compare
their solutions with the authors'.

* The ISA used by the authors is not the same of the 'standard'
used in the SimpleScalar: this again generates problems for
comparing their results with others'. It would be nice to have,
as baseline, the IPC reached with the same banchmarks (and SGI ISA)
when the basic architecture is a superscalar with large
Instruction Windows and comparable hardware resources, as provided
by the SimpleScalar simulator.

- Results:

* The architecture you describe is quite complex: the L0,
Forwarding Units (FUs), Disjoint Eager Execution (DEE),
Value Speculation, and quite aggessive optimizations are applied.
Since it is already known that many of this techniques provides
an important speedup (e.g. Value Speculation alone could
provide a 50% increase of IPC), it would be interesting to see
a breakdown of the IPC showing how each component of the architecture
improves the IPC.

* A rough extimate of the cost of this implementation would be
necessary in order to see if configurations like 32-4-16-16
are actually feasable.

* More important, since the goal of the paper is also to investigate
the memory-latency tolerance, it would be interesting to see how
a Superscalar architecture with large IW would tolerate an increase
in L1-L2-MM latencies. Is this benefit all due to Value Speculation
and/or L0 cache or not?

- Other issues that need to be improved:

* The presentation of the architecture is to wordy and difficult
to read. I'd suggest to insert some more detailed figure.

* Please introduce the concepts that you use immediately: some of them
are only explained much more later in the Section.

This paper introduces an interesting new microprocessor
microarchitecture with 

excellent simulation results. 

However, the complex microarchitecture is hard to understand. 
Operating principles and implementation details are mixed in a way which
is 

hard to digest. 

I suggest to start with the principles, then decribe the
microarchitecture top 

down.
Perhaps focus the paper on the decription of the new principles, and
provide 

less implementation details, e.g. the Operand snoop logic (Fig. 3).
A block diagram of the overall machine structure might help, also a more 

detailed description how the fetched code is distributed to the AS.

>>>>The Comments to authors

In this paper the authors further explore previosly 
proposed multipath architecture
based on a large mesh of processing elements.
(reference [17], published by the same authors at Europar 2002).
The simulation results presented in this paper show that
the performance of the proposed architecture 
does not significantly decrease with increased L1, L2, and memory latency.

The authors should make a clear distinction between this paper
and the Europar reference, and emphasize this paper's contribution -
architecture's insensitivity to memory latency.
The design space and simulator are also different.

Paper should be carefully checked for consistency,
for example, a term "D-path" is used just in tables 3 and 4,
while a term "DEE path" is used throughout the rest of the paper.
There is no explanation of release D-path strategy (Table 4),
probably being DEE multipath execution.

Some syntax/semantic remarks:
Page 3, paragraph 1:
.."but is simpler is some respects."
Should be ..."but is simpler in some respects."

"The multiple buses going from the i-fetch unit to the execution window
