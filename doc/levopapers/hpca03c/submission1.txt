Abstract:
We discuss how time tags can be used for the enforcement of
program dependencies.  Time tags can serve as the basic ordering
enforcement mechanism when a large number of instructions are executing
concurrently.  Proposed and future microarchitectures can have hundreds
or several hundreds of instructions in flight simultaneously. Using
standard reservation tags, physical register addresses, and reorder
buffers, performance does not scale well even for moderate-sized
instruction windows.  Time tags address much of the complication of
these units.

In this paper we discuss the design, use and management of time tags.
We also provide simulation data for an example microarchitecture that
illustrates the advantages of using time tags for dependency
enforcement.  IPCs in the range of 3.8-5.1 are obtained for the range
of machine configurations studied running SpecInt-2000 and SpecInt-95
programs.
