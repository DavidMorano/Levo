Prof. kaeli,

Here are the data for oracle simulations.  I have done two sets of
simulations, one with cache and one without it.  There is NO VALUE
PREDICTION.  As you can see, for small machines, our D+VP out-performace
this result.  

I have include the (8,8,16) config but you might want to skip that because
we don't have any data for it.  But as you see, it outperforms the rest.

Also note that 3 entries are still missing and I am waiting for them.

If we are lucky, we might get the other D-path simulations before
deadline.  although so far, for (8,4,8) and go I didn't see an improvement 

I'll keep you posted
Ali
