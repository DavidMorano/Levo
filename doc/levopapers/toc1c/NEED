Things that still need a little fixing.


+ figure 3 need its columned labeld 'CEP' to be changed to be
  'CEPB'.

+ maybe a figure for III-D showing the horizontal L1-D cache
  accesses buses

+ "flushing" of MFU's ?  What is this about ?

+ do we retire an AS column with a DEE path still in the other
  half of the ASes within the same SG column ?  if so, how are
  the registers in the RFU's of that column handled ?

+ one or more of the figures have the following fonts that 
  NEED TO BE CHANGED TO either 'Helvetica' or 'Times' or one
  of the other 35 standard publishing fonts :

	TTE2Do00 used in file brdomain.eps
	ArialMT used in file toc_geom.eps
	Arial-BoldMT used in file toc_geom.eps

  these fonts are not standard publishing fonts and should not be
  used ; 'Ariel' is just Mickey$ofts proprietary version of 'Helvetica' ->
  use 'Helvetica' instead !
