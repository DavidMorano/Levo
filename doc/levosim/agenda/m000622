+ fully clock synchronous buses

  There are tradeoffs with the choice.  With a fully synchronous
  bus the coding should be easier and less error prone.  Without
  one, it is sometimes possible to gain one fewer clock delays
  to writing a bus.

+ column renaming

  We HAVE to rename columns because a bus request in progress for a
  forwarding bus (which is physical) will be lost if we actually
  performed a copy shift !

+ memory committed store bus 

  We need this because we have to be able to shift out of the IW on
  essentially every clock as we cannot do that if we have to serialize
  store requests for that bus !

  An approach to this is to put committed write-store FIFOs on
  the output of the rows so that committed writes have some place
  to go in a single clock.
