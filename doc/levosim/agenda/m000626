Levo Meeting Monday 00/06/26


+ machine shift and programming convention

All object should not request actions of other objects near
the end of a clock cycle, like in phase 3.

Why ?  Because, there has to be time enough for each object to
possibly perform a machine shift operation !  Objects
should only make requests of other objects in (primarily)
phases 1 through 2.


+ stale data on the buses !

Note that currently a machine shift will not affect any TT-data
that is in transit on a bus !  How do we want to handle this ?
