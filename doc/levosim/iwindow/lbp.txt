Description:   Levo branch predictor

Inputs:		Addresses of branches. Outcome of branches.

Outputs:	Predicted branch target addresses.

Subsystem core:  A two level branch predictor. It reads the address of a
		branch, computes the branch history register and an index
		to access the pattern history register. The pattern history
		entries contain 2-bit saturating counters used in joint with
		branch history taken/not taken frequency to determine how
		a given branch must be predicted. 

Testing strategy: To be discussed. 

Status of subsystem:  
		Design: 50%
		Code:	10-15% to be adapted to Levo code style.
