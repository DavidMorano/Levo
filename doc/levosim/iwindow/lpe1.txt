lexec.h  instruction execution routines

Overview description:
This uint is responsible for taking an instruction from Active
stations and executing it.  The execution delay is taken into
account.  I have tried to approximate a pipelined execution unit
where a new instruction could be issued in each cycle and they can
be completed out of order.

Inputs: an instuction pack.  the "req2exec" method is called to 
put the instruciton in the exection queue.

Outputs:
an instuction pack with the result entry filled with the 
outcome of the instruction execution.
