Description:
        Program that reads instructions from the fetch buffer, decodes them
        and stores decoded instructions in the load buffer.
	
Inputs:		A set of undecoded instructions read from fetch buffer.
	
Outputs 	A set of decoded instructions stored in the load buffer, 
		a structure with information for each instruction:
		- execution pseudo_opcode, 
		- class, 
		- instruction pointer (ilptr)
		- addresses of source registers,
		- addresses of destination registers,
		- immediate values,	
		- jump and branch offsets, or
		- addresses of registers for indirect jumps and branches
			
Subsystem core: Loop that reads instructions from fetch buffer. It decodes
		the instructions, identifies branch instructions, stores
		them in branch tracking buffer and sets predicates for 
		instructions within branch domains. It also sets fields
		of a structure to keep instructions information, like
		pseudo opcode, levo class, sources and destination addresses,
		offset and immediate values and original instruction.
	
Testing strategy:  Read instructions in binary format (32-bit width)
		   and generate printed output just to check instructions
		   are correctly decoded.

Status of subsystem:
	Design	85%, only to cover details related with branch tracking buffer
		and branch prediction.
	Coding  same.
