Description:	Implements MIPS instructions. 

Inputs:		Source, offset and immediate values. 
		Adresses for indirect jumps and branches (to be determined)
		or values to compute target addresses.

Outputs:	Results of operations, computed target addresses for
		jumps and branches (if given values as inputs).
		Number of clock cycles each instruction takes.

Subsystem core:  Classifies each instruction according to pseudo opcode
		 implements the corresponding MIPS-like operation.
		 Instructions are split in different groups to make an easier
		 interpretation in integer alu, floating point alu 
		(single or double precision), branches and compare.
		 
		

Testing strategy: Once decode is ready, it can be generated a list of
		  pseudo opcodes with source values to test that the
		  right operations are being implemented.

Status of subsystem:  
		Design 80-85%  depends on review by others.
		Code   70-75%  to add clock cycles for each instruction	
			       to check no erros on implementations,
				to add five instructions that were not
				implemented before
			      to check all sources and destinations are correct
