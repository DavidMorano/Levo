Description:	Fetches instructions from memory, resets load buffer
		and calls decode stage.

Inputs:		Set of instructions from memory.
	
Outputs:	Success or failure.
			
Subsystem core: Loop that fetches instructions from memory and uses decode 
		stage to fill load buffer from first to last program address.

Testing strategy: Not yet defined, but expecting to separately test each
		  of the subsystems it uses and then to integrate them.

Status of subsystem:
	Design	to be reviewed by others
	Coding  depends on observations from others.

Estimate date of completion:
