topic:		The Levo Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) Machine


		Abstract

This talk will give an overview of research that is being conducted
jointly between Professor Uht of the University of Rhode Island and
Professor Kaeli of Northeastern University.  This research (named Levo)
focuses on a novel way of extracting instruction level parallelism
(ILP) out of traditionally serial-intensive program codes.  The goal of
the research is to explore ways of extracting ILP using a novel machine
micro-architecture.  This talk will discuss the general problem of
speeding up programs, will give some brief background material on how
some of the ideas in Levo were developed, and will also give some brief
history of the Levo development over approximately the last two years.

Most of the rest of the talk will focus on the current version of the
Levo machine that is being explored and how it has the potential to
dramatically increase execution speed-ups of traditional (and even
legacy) programs codes through micro-architectural features.  The
program codes especially targeted for speedup are the familiar and
abundant single threaded integer oriented programs.  These have
traditionally been the hardest type of programs to speed up using
instruction level parallelism and I will try to show how Levo addresses
this most difficult challenge.
