We ran 3000 clocks of the Dhrystone program running on the Levo machine
configuration of 4-1-8-2-2 w/ 4-way memory interleave.

This machine is organized as :

        + single column
        + 4 Sharing Groups
        + 8 ASes high per each Sharing Group
        + a register forwarding bus span of 2
        + a register backwarding bus span of 2
        + a predicate forwarding bus span of 3
        + 4-way interleaved memory forwarding and backwarding buses

 
5054    register forwarding transactions (data & NULLIFYs)
        total STORE transactions                4395
                STORE transactions (data)       4395
                STORE transactions (no data)    0
        total NULLIFY transactions              659
 
3069    register backwarding transactions 
        total STORE transactions                3069
                STORE transactions (data)       1528
                STORE transactions (no data)    1541
 
657     predicate forwarding transactions
 
1177    memory forwarding transactions
        total STORE transactions                861
                STORE transactions (data)       861
                STORE transactions (no data)    0
        total NULLIFY transactions              316
 
466     memory backwarding transactions
        total STORE transactions                466
                STORE transactions (data)       466
                STORE transactions (no data)    0
 
 
I do not know how many instructions were committed in 3000 clocks but
2720 were fetched and loaded into the Levo Load Buffer.  I do not know
how many were able to ever get into the execution window.  
 
Note: having data or not doesn't really matter right now (or maybe
ever) for any backwarding transaction.
