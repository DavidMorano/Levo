LICACHE


This is the I-cache object for the Levo machine.

Let's see, we have to poll in each clock the Instruction Fetch Bus
(IFB) for requests.  Process those requests and then respond by placing
results on the Instruction Response Bus (IRB).  If we have to interact
with a main memory store or if there are multiple levels of caches, all
of those details and interactions have to be managed as well.
