GETINTERLEAVE


	int getinterleave(interleave,addr)
	uint	interleave, addr ;


	Arguments :

	+ interleave	the interleave schedule
	+ address	the address that is in view

	Returns :

	+ index		the bus index of the interleaved buses


	This subroutine takes an interleave schedule and an address and
	calculates which interleaved bus (by bus index) should be used
	for the associated operation given the address.

	The interleave schedule value is usually passed into
	the machine from the configuration information supplied
	at startup initialization time.

	The address value is usually a current address for which
	a proper memory bus needs to be identified for use by
	the transaction with that given address.
