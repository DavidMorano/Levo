This code depends on several other libraries that are not
specific to the Levo machine simulator project or its code.


OVERVIEW DESCRIPTION:

This code is called by the 'main()' subroutine and serves to
setup (and tear down afterwards) the simulation environment.
There are three main interactions with sub-objects made by this
code.  

The first is with the subobject 'LSIM'.  This code instantiates an LSIM
object and initializes it.

The major interaction is with the MINT subsystem stuff.  This code
initializes MINT.

The third major interaction of this code is with the top of the
Levo machine, which is embodied in the LEVO object.

The code then calls the LSIM subroutine that performs the
simulator looping-type function.  That subroutine will exit
when the program under simulation exits.

All objects are destructed (freed up) after a simulation has completed
and then this subroutine exits.


INPUTS:

The primary inputs to this subroutine are :

+ pointer to program information (created by 'main()')
+ the simulator program starting environment
+ a pointer to the simulator parameter file(s) object (a PARAMFILE)


OUTPUTS:

We return the exit status from the simulation.
