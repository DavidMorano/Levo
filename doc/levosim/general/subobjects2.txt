Questions :

> 1. who calls the comb function and when?

The 'clock' and 'comb' subroutines of each object are typically
called by the object that instantiates them in the first place.
This proceeds backward up the object instantiation hierarchy until
the top of the machine.

The constructor of an object should usually be called by the same
object that instantiates the object.  There may be some cases where
this may not be so but I cannot think of any.  In most languages with
OO support, an object is often instantiated and finally constructed at
the same time.  Of course, in C these two things occur at different
times (I do not want to mention how they may possibly occur at
essentially the same time).

The effect for your own programming is that if you create subobjects
that have 'clock' and 'comb' subroutines, you are responsible for
calling those subroutines from your object that instantiates the
subobjects.  Check out the little blurb in the code base area

for a simular discussion to what I have just mentioned.
