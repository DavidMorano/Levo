BUILDING LEVOSIM


Choose any of the alternatives : EASY, MORE_DIFFICULT, OTHER.



== EASY

$ makeit



== MORE DIFFICULT

Due to the slight increased complexity of our build environment (mostly
for portability and other reasons) the detailed build instructions
presented here are NOT complete and will NOT work as they are.  You
should reference the file 'makeit' about to see what is necessary for a
successful build.

Warning: THIS IS NOT COMPLETE !

Set an environment variable named 'LEVO' to the top of the LevoSim
package directory.  For example :

$ export LEVO=${HOME}/levosim

You should also have the environment variable 'LOCAL' set to a LOCAL
code distribution directory tree.  This is needed to pick up a copy of
Dave's favorite libraries.  For example :

$ export LOCAL=/marlin/morano/add-on/local

Set the following :

$ export OFD=S5
$ export OFF=s5
$ export OSTYPE=SYSV

Finally, you should set an environment variable 'LDCRTDIR' to be
where the standard common runtime object files are located.
For example :

$ export LDCRTDIR=/opt/SUNWspro/SC5.0/lib

Now go to the top of the source tree :

$ cd ${LEVO}/src/
$ make



== OTHER

For incremental piece code compilations you can do the following :

+ change to the subdirectory containing the stuff that you want to
  build

+ execute 'make upincs clean'

+ change to the top of the source tree again

+ execute something like : 'makeit <subdirectory_name>.o


An example would be something like :

$
$ cd ~/levosim
$ cd memory
$ make upincs clean
$ make lmem.o
$ cd ..
$ makeit memory.o
$
