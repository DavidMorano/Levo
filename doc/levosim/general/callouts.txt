Simulator Ultility Functions

Call-back requests


Make requests for call-backs in the future by calling :

	int lsim_callout(mip,func,objp,argp,nclocks,phase)
	struct mintinfo	*mip ;
	int	(*func)() ;
	void	*objp, *argp ;
	int	nclocks ;
	int	phase ;

where :

	mip	pointer to 'struct mintinfo' that you should have
		stored in your object data

	func	the address of the function that you want called
		when the time comes

	objp	a pointer to your object data

	argp	any random argument, use 'NULL' if you do not
		need it

	nclocks	the number of clocks in the future that you
		want to be called in

	phase	the phase that you want to be called back in
		(specify something like 2 if you do not care)

When you expiration time arrives, your function will be called as :

	            int (*func)(objp,argp,phase) ;

Your call-back subroutine should look something like :

	int name_callback(objp,argp,phase)
	name	*objp ;
	void	*argp ;
	int	phase ;

Currently the returned value is ignored but maybe in the future
we can thing of something to do with it.  Of course, change the
names to reflect whatever you want.

The current clock can be read by calling :


	{
		ULONG	clocks ;


		lsim_getclock(mip,&clocks) ;

	}

where :

	mip	is a pointer to the 'struct mintinfo' of the
		simulator

	clocks	is your 64-bit unsigned integer to hold the result
