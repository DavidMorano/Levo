I created a new subroutine (as requested) to test for a memory fault at
Levo i-fetch time.  After discussing the issue of not having a MMU
modeled in the Levo machine with Marcos and Maryam, we came to the
conclusion to not allow memory references that would have faulted if a
modeled MMU were present to go on to Maryam and her memory subsystem
where she would eventually get the fault and have to pass it back up to
Marcos in i-fetch.  Now Marcos will check for a possible memory fault
before he passes any instruction requests off to Maryam.  This pretty
much mimics what a modeled MMU would have done (in terms of memory
faults) if we had one.  Alireza should check for possible data memory
reference faults also before passing requests out to the memory system
proper.  Data read requests should probably be checked in the ASes
which write requests could be checked in the output stage of the Levo
Write Queues.  There may be some need for finer tuning with where
memory faults are first checked but in general we would prefer that
Maryam not have to deal with them because she would not be in a real
machine with a real MMU.
