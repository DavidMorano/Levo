= subroutine to get the instruction addresses out of an AS

This subroutine is used to read out the instruction address (if an
instruction is loaded) from a Levo Action Station (LAS object).
This subroutine should query the CURRENT state of the LAS, not its
possible NEXT state.

	int las_getia(llbp,iap)
	LLB	*llbp ;
	uint	*iap ;


Arguments:

lasp		pointer to the LAS object
iap		pointer to the caller's unsigned integer to receive the 
		instruction address

Returns:

>=0		an instruction was present and its address was returned
SR_EMPTY	no instruction is currently loaded
<0		some other bad error
