LDCACHE


This is the D-cache object for the Levo machine.

We have to poll in each clock the buses that we can get both load
requests on some set of interleaved buses (these are the
backwarding-oriented buses from the Levo i-window) and memory write
(store) requests on another set of interleaved memory buses.

Store requests are processed and there is no response (currently)
to the i-window about their final disposition.

Load requests must be processed and then we have to respond by placing
results on the a set of interleaved buses for that purpose.  These
latter buses are the forwarding-oriented buses from the Levo i-window.
If we have to interact with a main memory store or if there are
multiple levels of caches, all of those details and interactions have
to be managed as well.
