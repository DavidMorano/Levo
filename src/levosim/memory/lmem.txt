LMEM


This code object forms the top of the memory subsystem for Levo.

Currently this object just instantiates the i-cache and d-cache
subobjects and manages them.

The i-cache subobject is 'licache' and the d-cache subobject is
'ldcache'.

This present object gets references to the various buses
that come over to memory from the Levo i-window.  These buses
are pretty much just passed down to our subobjects as appropriate
for the read work to occur in them.
