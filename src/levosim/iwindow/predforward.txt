This code is dependent on the 'frame' and 'mint' subsystems of
the simulator program as well as the 'iw' object that instantiates
it and provides the initial basis for the information contained in
the 'levoinfo' data structure.


OVERVIEW DESCRIPTION:

This object forms a Levo component that is used for the forwarding of
predicate values to later time tagged value ASes.  The componet is used
to break up long predicate forwarding buses into smaller (programmable
sized) pieces.  This component has two buses coming to it, an input
Predicate Forwarding Bus and an output Predicate Forwarding Bus.  We
copy all predicate forwarding transactions on our input Predicate
Forwarding Bus for forwarding to our out-going Predicate Forwarding
Bus.  When we get a value to forward, we queue it up in our internal
out-going FIFO for forwarding on the out-going Predicate forwarding
bus.


INPUTS:

Primary inputs to this code are :
a pointer to program information ('proginfo' data structure)
a pointer to the simulator information ('mintinfo')
a pointer to the Levo machine information ('levoinfo')
pointers to the various Levo buses that we connect to


OUTPUTS:

The primary code output is a possible failure of the machine
instantiation either directly by this code or by any of the subobjects
created.


IDENTIFY UNDER WHICH COMPONENT THIS CODE FALLS:

This code forms its own category ; namely, the PREDFORWARD category.
