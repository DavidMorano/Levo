The code for load buffer is at llb.[ch].  The interface is final. (so
far!).  I haven't finished writing the whole body for llb_insert() as I 
need Marcos to come up with a final definition for LDECODE data structure.
David, you need to pass a pointer to llb structure to the decode module.
ASs will use las_load(LLB *, index) to copy the instructions from load
buffer into thier internal data structures.  You need to call
las_load_completed() after all ASs have thier values loaded.
