This code is dependent on the 'frame' and 'mint' subsystems of
the simulator program as well as the 'levo' object that instantiates
us and provides the initial basis for the information contained in
the 'levoinfo' data structure.


OVERVIEW DESCRIPTION:

This object forms the top of the Levo machine instruction window.
Under this object all other Levo machine specific objects that are
considered part of the I-window are eventually instantiated.  This
currently includes most all code that forms the majority of the Levo
machine.

The major Levo subobjects of this object are the :

some memory forwarding buses ('bus')
some memory backwarding buses ('bus')
the register forwarding buses ('bus')
the register backwarding buses ('bus')
Levo Active Stations ('las')
Levo Processing Elements ('lpe')
the Register Filter Units ('regfilter')
the Memory Filter Units ('memfilter')
the Memory Write Queues ('wqueues')
the Levo Ifetch Unit ('lifetch')
other components to be finalized

This object takes an interconnections, the instruction and memory
buses that go over and connect to the memory subsystem of the Levo
machine.


INPUTS:

Primary inputs to this code are :
a pointer to program information ('proginfo' data structure)
a pointer to a parameter object ('PARAMFILE')
a pointer to the simulator information ('mintinfo')
a pointer to the Levo machine information ('levoinfo')
pointers to the various Levo buses that we connect to


OUTPUTS:

The primary code output is a possible failure of the machine
instantiation either directly by this code or by any of the subobjects
created.


IDENTIFY UNDER WHICH COMPONENT THIS CODE FALLS:

This code forms its own category ; namely, the top of the
Levo machine instruction window hierarchy.


UNDER SUBSYSTEM:

iwindow


PUBLIC SUBROUTINES:

standard calls:

iw_init()
iw_free()
iw_comb()
iw_clock()

special calls:

* none so far *


INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER CODE:

levo:

The LEVO code instantiates us and makes all of our standard
method calls : las_init(), las_free(), las_comb(), las_clock() 

llb:

We call the LLB XXXX() calls when XXXX needs to be done.

lpe:

We instantiate all of the LPE objects and call their standard
calls: lpe_init(), lpe_free(), lpe_comb(), lpe_clock()
