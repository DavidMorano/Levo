This code is dependent on the 'frame' and 'mint' subsystems of
the simulator program.


OVERVIEW DESCRIPTION:

This object is a bus component object.   This bus is used (or will try
to be used) by many components in the Levo machine to implement most of
the buses in the Levo instruction window.  This code implements a very
low-level bus that is not always easy to use.  This object does,
however, allow for a good amount of flexibility in how a bus may be
used further.  The basic data portion of this bus is currently made up
of a Levo Flow Group data structure ('lflowgroup' -- credit to Jennifer
Black for the name).  The use of this Levo Flow Group data structure
allows the bus to be fairly generic rather than being concerned with
many details of the data passing on it.


INPUTS:

There are few needed inputs to this code.  The main inputs are :  a
pointer to the program information ('proginfo' data structure -- mostly
for debugging), the number of requests that this bus may handle when
used in a multi-master configuration, and the width of the bus in
DATAVAL (data structure 'DATAVAL') units.


OUTPUTS:

The primary code output is a possible failure of initialization
either directly by this code or by any of the subobjects
created.


IDENTIFY UNDER WHICH COMPONENT THIS CODE FALLS:

This code falls under the coding category of Levo machine
buses.


PUBLIC SUBROUTINES:

standard calls:

bus_init()
bus_free()
bus_comb()
bus_clock()

special object call:

bus_read()
bus_write()



PUBLIC SUBROUTINE DESCRIPTIONS :

The most useful (and most public) subroutines are described here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
int bus_read(op,lfgp)
BUS		*op ;
LFLOWGROUP	*lfgp ;

This subroutine is used to read something off of the bus.

Arguments :

op	pointer to the RFBUS object
lfgp	pointer to a LFLOWGROUP object to receive the data from the bus

Returns :

0	nothing was on the bus in this current clock period
<0	some sort of error, usually a coding problem
1	something was read off of the bus and it is in the suppled
	LFLOWGROUP object whose reference was passed


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
int bus_write(op,lfgp,n)
BUS		*op ;
LFLOWGROUP	*lfgp ;

This subroutine is used to write something to the bus.

Arguments :

op		pointer to the RFBUS object
lfgp		pointer to a LFLOWGROUP object to write to the bus

Returns :

SR_BUSY		bus was busy ; try again the next clock
<0		some sort of error, usually a coding problem
>=1		the data was successfully written to the bus
